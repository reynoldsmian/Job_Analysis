Idea behind the project:
Job Description Keyword Search
 - Currently there is a large number of people turning to online learning. One of the most difficult tasks that these students will face is what to learn/ what courses to take. This project gives a tool to compare how often skills are mentioned across the job market.

 - Add functionality to the scraper to obtain all of the job descriptions

 - Add database functionality to track trends over time

 To-do:
